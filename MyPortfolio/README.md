How This Website Was Made

Introduction

This website is a work-in-progress designed to showcase my web development skills. The project is built with HTML, CSS, and will eventually incorporate JavaScript for interactivity. The design was initially created in Figma, and the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. As I continue to develop the site, I plan to add more content, improve the design for better responsiveness, and enhance interactivity using JavaScript.

Planning & Design

Before starting the development process, I created the initial design using Figma. This helped me visualize the structure of the website and experiment with different design elements before coding.

Wireframes and Prototypes: Created using Figma to define layout and interactions.
Design Iterations: Tested different color schemes, typography, and layout styles to find the best fit for the siteâ€™s purpose.

Tech Stack & Resources

HTML: Used for the structure of the website.
CSS: Styled the site and began implementing responsive design using Flexbox and Grid.
JavaScript (Future): Plan to add interactive elements (e.g., dynamic content, form validation).
Figma: Used for initial wireframing and design prototypes.
GitHub Pages: The site is hosted here for free.

Resources I found helpful:
FreeCodeCamp: How to Build a Developer Portfolio Website
W3Schools: Referenced for basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Development Process

I followed an iterative development process:

Initial Setup: Started with a basic HTML structure.
Layout & Design: Applied CSS to create the layout and ensure responsiveness on larger screens.
Future Plans (JavaScript): In future updates, I plan to add JavaScript to enhance interactivity.
Responsive Design Adjustments: Will continue refining the site for different screen sizes using media queries and other responsive design techniques.
Content Expansion: The website will eventually feature more content, including project showcases and blog posts.

Deployment

Platform: The website is hosted on GitHub Pages.
Deployment Process: Once I make updates locally, I push the changes to GitHub, and GitHub Pages automatically updates the live site.

Future Improvements

JavaScript Integration: Plan to add JavaScript for interactive features such as form validation, modals, and dynamic content updates.
Responsive Design: Further adjustments will be made to ensure the website is fully responsive on all devices, including smartphones and tablets.
Content Updates: More content will be added to showcase my projects, skills, and a portfolio section.
SEO & Accessibility: Improve SEO and make the site more accessible with better semantic HTML and ARIA roles.
